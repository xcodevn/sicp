<a id="Exploiting-the-Stream-Paradigm"></a>
<h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">3.5.3</span><span class="sectitle">Exploiting the Stream Paradigm</span></h4>

<p>Streams with delayed evaluation can be a powerful modeling tool, providing many
of the benefits of local state and assignment.  Moreover, they avoid some of
the theoretical tangles that accompany the introduction of assignment into a
programming language.
</p>
<p>The stream approach can be illuminating because it allows us to build systems
with different module boundaries than systems organized around assignment to
state variables.  For example, we can think of an entire time series (or
signal) as a focus of interest, rather than the values of the state variables
at individual moments.  This makes it convenient to combine and compare
components of state from different moments.
</p>
<a id="Formulating-iterations-as-stream-processes"></a>
<h5 class="subsubheading">Formulating iterations as stream processes</h5>

<p>In section <a href="1_002e2_002e1.xhtml#g_t1_002e2_002e1">1.2.1</a>, we introduced iterative processes, which proceed by
updating state variables.  We know now that we can represent state as a
“timeless” stream of values rather than as a set of variables to be updated.
Let’s adopt this perspective in revisiting the square-root procedure from
<a href="1_002e1_002e7.xhtml#g_t1_002e1_002e7">1.1.7</a>.  Recall that the idea is to generate a sequence of better
and better guesses for the square root of \( x \) by applying over and over again
the procedure that improves guesses:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (sqrt-improve guess x)
  (average guess (/ x guess)))
</pre></div>

<p>In our original <code>sqrt</code> procedure, we made these guesses be the successive
values of a state variable. Instead we can generate the infinite stream of
guesses, starting with an initial guess of 1:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF193" href="#FOOT193"><sup>193</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (sqrt-stream x)
  (define guesses
    (cons-stream 
     1.0 (stream-map
          (lambda (guess)
            (sqrt-improve guess x))
          guesses)))
  guesses)

(display-stream (sqrt-stream 2))
<i>1.</i>
<i>1.5</i>
<i>1.4166666666666665</i>
<i>1.4142156862745097</i>
<i>1.4142135623746899</i>
<span class="roman">…</span>
</pre></div>

<p>We can generate more and more terms of the stream to get better and better
guesses.  If we like, we can write a procedure that keeps generating terms
until the answer is good enough.  (See <a href="#Exercise-3_002e64">Exercise 3.64</a>.)
</p>
<p>Another iteration that we can treat in the same way is to generate an
approximation to \( \pi \), based upon the alternating series that we saw in
<a href="1_002e3_002e1.xhtml#g_t1_002e3_002e1">1.3.1</a>:
\[ % :66:
  {\pi\over4} \,=\, 1 - {1\over3} + {1\over5} - {1\over7} + {\dots.}  \]
We first generate the stream of summands of the series (the reciprocals of the
odd integers, with alternating signs).  Then we take the stream of sums of more
and more terms (using the <code>partial-sums</code> procedure of <a href="3_002e5_002e2.xhtml#Exercise-3_002e55">Exercise 3.55</a>)
and scale the result by 4:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (pi-summands n)
  (cons-stream 
   (/ 1.0 n)
   (stream-map - (pi-summands (+ n 2)))))

(define pi-stream
  (scale-stream 
   (partial-sums (pi-summands 1)) 4))

(display-stream pi-stream)
<i>4.</i>
<i>2.666666666666667</i>
<i>3.466666666666667</i>
<i>2.8952380952380956</i>

<i>3.2837384837384844</i>
<i>3.017071817071818</i>
<span class="roman">…</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This gives us a stream of better and better approximations to \( \pi \),
although the approximations converge rather slowly.  Eight terms of the
sequence bound the value of \( \pi \) between 3.284 and 3.017.
</p>
<p>So far, our use of the stream of states approach is not much different from
updating state variables.  But streams give us an opportunity to do some
interesting tricks.  For example, we can transform a stream with a
<a id="index-sequence-accelerator"></a>
<em>sequence accelerator</em> that converts a sequence of approximations to a
new sequence that converges to the same value as the original, only faster.
</p>
<p>One such accelerator, due to the eighteenth-century Swiss mathematician
Leonhard Euler, works well with sequences that are partial sums of alternating
series (series of terms with alternating signs).  In Euler’s technique, if
\( S_n \) is the \( n^{\text{th}} \) term of the original sum sequence, then the
accelerated sequence has terms
\[ % :67:
  S_{n+1} - {{(S_{n+1} - S_n)^2 \over S_{n-1} - 2S_n + S_{n+1}}.}  \]
Thus, if the original sequence is represented as a stream of values, the
transformed sequence is given by
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (euler-transform s)
  (let ((s0 (stream-ref s 0))     ; <var>Sₙ</var>₋₁
        (s1 (stream-ref s 1))     ; <var>Sₙ</var>
        (s2 (stream-ref s 2)))    ; <var>Sₙ</var>₊₁
    (cons-stream 
     (- s2 (/ (square (- s2 s1))
              (+ s0 (* -2 s1) s2)))
     (euler-transform (stream-cdr s)))))
</pre></div>

<p>We can demonstrate Euler acceleration with our sequence of approximations to
\( \pi \):
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(display-stream 
 (euler-transform pi-stream))
<i>3.166666666666667</i>
<i>3.1333333333333337</i>
<i>3.1452380952380956</i>
<i>3.13968253968254</i>
<i>3.1427128427128435</i>
<i>3.1408813408813416</i>
<i>3.142071817071818</i>
<i>3.1412548236077655</i>
<span class="roman">…</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Even better, we can accelerate the accelerated sequence, and recursively
accelerate that, and so on.  Namely, we create a stream of streams (a structure
we’ll call a <a id="index-tableau"></a>
<em>tableau</em>) in which each stream is the transform of the
preceding one:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-tableau transform s)
  (cons-stream 
   s
   (make-tableau
    transform
    (transform s))))
</pre></div>

<p>The tableau has the form
\[ % :68:

\begin{array}{cccccc}
 s_{00} 	&amp;   s_{01}  	&amp;   s_{02}  	&amp;   s_{03}  	&amp;   s_{04}  	&amp;   \dots  \\
		&amp;   s_{10}  	&amp;   s_{11}  	&amp;   s_{12}  	&amp;   s_{13}  	&amp;   \dots  \\
		&amp; 		&amp;   s_{20}  	&amp;   s_{21}  	&amp;   s_{22}  	&amp;   \dots  \\
		&amp; 		&amp; 		&amp;   \dots  	&amp; 		&amp;   
\end{array}
\]
Finally, we form a sequence by taking the first term in each row of the
tableau:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (accelerated-sequence transform s)
  (stream-map stream-car
              (make-tableau transform s)))
</pre></div>

<p>We can demonstrate this kind of “super-acceleration” of the \( \pi \)
sequence:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(display-stream 
 (accelerated-sequence euler-transform
                       pi-stream))
<i>4.</i>
<i>3.166666666666667</i>
<i>3.142105263157895</i>
<i>3.141599357319005</i>
<i>3.1415927140337785</i>
<i>3.1415926539752927</i>
<i>3.1415926535911765</i>
<i>3.141592653589778</i>
<span class="roman">…</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The result is impressive.  Taking eight terms of the sequence yields the
correct value of \( \pi \) to 14 decimal places.  If we had used only the
original \( \pi \) sequence, we would need to compute on the order of \( 10^{13} \)
terms (i.e., expanding the series far enough so that the individual terms are
less than \( 10^{-13} \)) to get that much accuracy!
</p>
<p>We could have implemented these acceleration techniques without using streams.
But the stream formulation is particularly elegant and convenient because the
entire sequence of states is available to us as a data structure that can be
manipulated with a uniform set of operations.

<p>Alyssa P. Hacker replies that this version of the procedure is considerably
less efficient because it performs redundant computation.  Explain Alyssa’s
answer.  Would the two versions still differ in efficiency if our
implementation of <code>delay</code> used only <code>(lambda () ⟨<var>exp</var>⟩)</code> without

<a id="Infinite-streams-of-pairs"></a>
<h5 class="subsubheading">Infinite streams of pairs</h5>

<p>In <a href="2_002e2_002e3.xhtml#g_t2_002e2_002e3">2.2.3</a>, we saw how the sequence paradigm handles traditional
nested loops as processes defined on sequences of pairs.  If we generalize this
technique to infinite streams, then we can write programs that are not easily
represented as loops, because the “looping” must range over an infinite set.
</p>
<p>For example, suppose we want to generalize the <code>prime-sum-pairs</code> procedure
of <a href="2_002e2_002e3.xhtml#g_t2_002e2_002e3">2.2.3</a> to produce the stream of pairs of <em>all</em> integers
\( {(i, j)} \) with \( {i \le j} \) such that \( {i + j} \) is prime.  If
<code>int-pairs</code> is the sequence of all pairs of integers \( {(i, j)} \) with
\( {i \le j} \), then our required stream is simply<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF194" href="#FOOT194"><sup>194</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(stream-filter 
 (lambda (pair)
   (prime? (+ (car pair) (cadr pair))))
 int-pairs)
</pre></div>

<p>Our problem, then, is to produce the stream <code>int-pairs</code>.  More generally,
suppose we have two streams \( {S = (S_i)} \) and \( {T = (T_j)} \),
and imagine the infinite rectangular array
\[ % :70:

\begin{array}{cccc}
	 (S_0, T_0)  &amp;  (S_0, T_1)  &amp;  (S_0, T_2)  &amp;  \dots  \\
	 (S_1, T_0)  &amp;  (S_1, T_1)  &amp;  (S_1, T_2)  &amp;  \dots  \\
	 (S_2, T_0)  &amp;  (S_2, T_1)  &amp;  (S_2, T_2)  &amp;  \dots  \\
	 \dots  &amp; &amp; &amp; 
\end{array}
\]
We wish to generate a stream that contains all the pairs in the array that lie
on or above the diagonal, i.e., the pairs
\[ % :71:

\begin{array}{cccc}
 (S_0, T_0)  	&amp;  (S_0, T_1)  	&amp;  (S_0, T_2)  	&amp;  \dots  \\
		&amp;  (S_1, T_1)  	&amp;  (S_1, T_2)  	&amp;  \dots  \\
		&amp; 		&amp;  (S_2, T_2)  	&amp;  \dots  \\
		&amp; 		&amp; 		&amp;  \dots 
\end{array}
\]
(If we take both \( S \) and \( T \) to be the stream of integers, then this will
be our desired stream <code>int-pairs</code>.)
</p>
<p>Call the general stream of pairs <code>(pairs S T)</code>, and consider it to be
composed of three parts: the pair \( {(S_0, T_0)} \), the rest of the pairs in
the first row, and the remaining pairs:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF195" href="#FOOT195"><sup>195</sup></a>
\[ % :72:

\begin{array}{c|ccc}
 (S_0, T_0)  	&amp;  (S_0, T_1)  	&amp;  (S_0, T_2)  	&amp;  \dots  \\
\hline
		&amp;  (S_1, T_1)  	&amp;  (S_1, T_2)  	&amp;  \dots  \\
		&amp; 		&amp;  (S_2, T_2)  	&amp;  \dots  \\
		&amp; 		&amp; 		&amp;  \dots  
\end{array}
\]
Observe that the third piece in this decomposition (pairs that are not in the
first row) is (recursively) the pairs formed from <code>(stream-cdr S)</code> and
<code>(stream-cdr T)</code>.  Also note that the second piece (the rest of the first
row) is
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(stream-map (lambda (x) 
              (list (stream-car s) x))
            (stream-cdr t))
</pre></div>

<p>Thus we can form our stream of pairs as follows:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (pairs s t)
  (cons-stream
   (list (stream-car s) (stream-car t))
   (⟨<var>combine-in-some-way</var>⟩
    (stream-map (lambda (x) 
                  (list (stream-car s) x))
                (stream-cdr t))
    (pairs (stream-cdr s)
           (stream-cdr t)))))
</pre></div>

<p>In order to complete the procedure, we must choose some way to combine the two
inner streams.  One idea is to use the stream analog of the <code>append</code>
procedure from <a href="2_002e2_002e1.xhtml#g_t2_002e2_002e1">2.2.1</a>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (stream-append s1 s2)
  (if (stream-null? s1)
      s2
      (cons-stream 
       (stream-car s1)
       (stream-append (stream-cdr s1) s2))))
</pre></div>

<p>This is unsuitable for infinite streams, however, because it takes all the
elements from the first stream before incorporating the second stream.  In
particular, if we try to generate all pairs of positive integers using
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(pairs integers integers)
</pre></div>

<p>our stream of results will first try to run through all pairs with the first
integer equal to 1, and hence will never produce pairs with any other value of
the first integer.
</p>
<p>To handle infinite streams, we need to devise an order of combination that
ensures that every element will eventually be reached if we let our program run
long enough.  An elegant way to accomplish this is with the following
<code>interleave</code> procedure:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF196" href="#FOOT196"><sup>196</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (interleave s1 s2)
  (if (stream-null? s1)
      s2
      (cons-stream 
       (stream-car s1)
       (interleave s2 (stream-cdr s1)))))
</pre></div>

<p>Since <code>interleave</code> takes elements alternately from the two streams, every
element of the second stream will eventually find its way into the interleaved
stream, even if the first stream is infinite.
</p>
<p>We can thus generate the required stream of pairs as
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (pairs s t)
  (cons-stream
   (list (stream-car s) (stream-car t))
   (interleave
    (stream-map (lambda (x) 
                  (list (stream-car s) x))
                (stream-cdr t))
    (pairs (stream-cdr s) (stream-cdr t)))))
</pre></div>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Streams as signals</h5>

<p>We began our discussion of streams by describing them as computational analogs
of the “signals” in signal-processing systems.  In fact, we can use streams
to model signal-processing systems in a very direct way, representing the
values of a signal at successive time intervals as consecutive elements of a
stream.  For instance, we can implement an <a id="index-integrator"></a>
<em>integrator</em> or
<a id="index-summer"></a>
<em>summer</em> that, for an input stream \( {x = (x_i)} \), an initial
value \( C \), and a small increment \( {dt} \), accumulates the sum
\[ % :73:
  S_i \,=\, C + {\sum_{j\kern0.07em = \kern0.03em 1}^i x_j \kern0.1em dt}  \]
and returns the stream of values \( {S = (S_i)} \).  The following
<code>integral</code> procedure is reminiscent of the “implicit style” definition
of the stream of integers (<a href="3_002e5_002e2.xhtml#g_t3_002e5_002e2">3.5.2</a>):
</p>
<div class="lisp">

  (define int

     initial-value
     (add-streams (scale-stream integrand dt)
                  int)))
  int)
</pre></div>

<p><a href="#Figure-3_002e32">Figure 3.32</a> is a picture of a signal-processing system that corresponds
to the <code>integral</code> procedure.  The input stream is scaled by \( {dt} \) and
passed through an adder, whose output is passed back through the same adder.
The self-reference in the definition of <code>int</code> is reflected in the figure
by the feedback loop that connects the output of the adder to one of the
inputs.

<p><strong><a id="Exercise-3_002e73"></a>Exercise 3.73:</strong> We can model electrical circuits
using streams to represent the values of currents or voltages at a sequence of
times.  For instance, suppose we have an <a id="index-RC-circuit"></a>
<em>RC circuit</em> consisting of a
resistor of resistance \( R \) and a capacitor of capacitance \( C \) in series.
The voltage response \( v \) of the circuit to an injected current \( i \) is
determined by the formula in <a href="#Figure-3_002e33">Figure 3.33</a>, whose structure is shown by the
accompanying signal-flow diagram.

<p>Write a procedure <code>RC</code> that models this circuit.  <code>RC</code> should take as
inputs the values of \( R \), \( C \), and \( {dt} \) and should return a procedure
that takes as inputs a stream representing the current \( i \) and an initial
value for the capacitor voltage \( v_0 \) and produces as output the stream of
voltages \( v \).  For example, you should be able to use <code>RC</code> to model an
RC circuit with \( R \) = 5 ohms, \( C \) = 1 farad, and a 0.5-second time step by
evaluating <code>(define RC1 (RC 5 1 0.5))</code>.  This defines <code>RC1</code> as a
procedure that takes a stream representing the time sequence of currents and an
initial capacitor voltage and produces the output stream of voltages.

<p><strong><a id="Exercise-3_002e74"></a>Exercise 3.74:</strong> Alyssa P. Hacker is designing a
system to process signals coming from physical sensors.  One important feature
she wishes to produce is a signal that describes the <a id="index-zero-crossings"></a>
<em>zero crossings</em>
of the input signal.  That is, the resulting signal should be \( {+1} \) whenever the
input signal changes from negative to positive, \( {-1} \) whenever the input signal
changes from positive to negative, and \( 0 \) otherwise.  (Assume that the sign of a
\( 0 \) input is positive.)  For example, a typical input signal with its associated
zero-crossing signal would be
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp"><span class="roman">…</span> 1 2 1.5 1 0.5 -0.1 -2 -3 -2 -0.5 0.2 3 4 <span class="roman">…</span>
<span class="roman">…</span> 0 0  0  0  0   -1   0  0  0   0   1  0 0 <span class="roman">…</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In Alyssa’s system, the signal from the sensor is represented as a stream
<code>sense-data</code> and the stream <code>zero-crossings</code> is the corresponding
stream of zero crossings.  Alyssa first writes a procedure
<code>sign-change-detector</code> that takes two values as arguments and compares the
signs of the values to produce an appropriate \( 0 \), \( 1 \), or \( {-1} \).  She then
constructs her zero-crossing stream as follows:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-zero-crossings
         input-stream last-value)
  (cons-stream
   (sign-change-detector 
    (stream-car input-stream) 
    last-value)
   (make-zero-crossings 
    (stream-cdr input-stream)
    (stream-car input-stream))))

(define zero-crossings 
  (make-zero-crossings sense-data 0))
</pre></div>

<p>Alyssa’s boss, Eva Lu Ator, walks by and suggests that this program is
approximately equivalent to the following one, which uses the generalized
version of <code>stream-map</code> from <a href="3_002e5_002e1.xhtml#Exercise-3_002e50">Exercise 3.50</a>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define zero-crossings
  (stream-map sign-change-detector 
              sense-data 
              ⟨<var>expression</var>⟩))
</pre></div>

<p>Complete the program by supplying the indicated <code>⟨</code><var>expression</var><code>⟩</code>.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><a id="Exercise-3_002e75"></a>Exercise 3.75:</strong> Unfortunately, Alyssa’s
zero-crossing detector in <a href="#Exercise-3_002e74">Exercise 3.74</a> proves to be insufficient,
because the noisy signal from the sensor leads to spurious zero crossings.  Lem
E.  Tweakit, a hardware specialist, suggests that Alyssa smooth the signal to
filter out the noise before extracting the zero crossings.  Alyssa takes his
advice and decides to extract the zero crossings from the signal constructed by
averaging each value of the sense data with the previous value.  She explains
the problem to her assistant, Louis Reasoner, who attempts to implement the
idea, altering Alyssa’s program as follows:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-zero-crossings 
         input-stream last-value)
  (let ((avpt 
         (/ (+ (stream-car input-stream) 
               last-value) 
            2)))
    (cons-stream 
     (sign-change-detector avpt last-value)
     (make-zero-crossings 
      (stream-cdr input-stream) avpt))))
</pre></div>

<p>This does not correctly implement Alyssa’s plan.  Find the bug that Louis has
installed and fix it without changing the structure of the program.  (Hint: You
will need to increase the number of arguments to <code>make-zero-crossings</code>.)
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><a id="Exercise-3_002e76"></a>Exercise 3.76:</strong> Eva Lu Ator has a criticism of
Louis’s approach in <a href="#Exercise-3_002e75">Exercise 3.75</a>.  The program he wrote is not modular,
because it intermixes the operation of smoothing with the zero-crossing
extraction.  For example, the extractor should not have to be changed if Alyssa
finds a better way to condition her input signal.  Help Louis by writing a
procedure <code>smooth</code> that takes a stream as input and produces a stream in
which each element is the average of two successive input stream elements.
Then use <code>smooth</code> as a component to implement the zero-crossing detector
in a more modular style.

the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.’
