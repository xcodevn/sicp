<a id="Infinite-Streams"></a>
<h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">3.5.2</span><span class="sectitle">Infinite Streams</span></h4>

<p>We have seen how to support the illusion of manipulating streams as complete
entities even though, in actuality, we compute only as much of the stream as we
need to access.  We can exploit this technique to represent sequences
efficiently as streams, even if the sequences are very long.  What is more
striking, we can use streams to represent sequences that are infinitely long.
For instance, consider the following definition of the stream of positive
integers:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (integers-starting-from n)
  (cons-stream 
   n (integers-starting-from (+ n 1))))
(define integers (integers-starting-from 1))
</pre></div>

<p>This makes sense because <code>integers</code> will be a pair whose <code>car</code> is 1
and whose <code>cdr</code> is a promise to produce the integers beginning with 2.
This is an infinitely long stream, but in any given time we can examine only a
finite portion of it.  Thus, our programs will never know that the entire
infinite stream is not there.
</p>
<p>Using <code>integers</code> we can define other infinite streams, such as the stream
of integers that are not divisible by 7:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (divisible? x y) (= (remainder x y) 0))
(define no-sevens
  (stream-filter (lambda (x) 
                   (not (divisible? x 7)))
                 integers))
</pre></div>

<p>Then we can find integers not divisible by 7 simply by accessing elements of
this stream:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(stream-ref no-sevens 100)
<i>117</i>
</pre></div>

<p>In analogy with <code>integers</code>, we can define the infinite stream of Fibonacci
numbers:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (fibgen a b)
  (cons-stream a (fibgen b (+ a b))))
(define fibs (fibgen 0 1))
</pre></div>

<p><code>Fibs</code> is a pair whose <code>car</code> is 0 and whose <code>cdr</code> is a promise
to evaluate <code>(fibgen 1 1)</code>.  When we evaluate this delayed <code>(fibgen 1
1)</code>, it will produce a pair whose <code>car</code> is 1 and whose <code>cdr</code> is a
promise to evaluate <code>(fibgen 1 2)</code>, and so on.
</p>
<p>For a look at a more exciting infinite stream, we can generalize the
<code>no-sevens</code> example to construct the infinite stream of prime numbers,
using a method known as the <a id="index-sieve-of-Eratosthenes"></a>
<em>sieve of Eratosthenes</em>.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF188" href="#FOOT188"><sup>188</sup></a>
We start with the integers beginning with 2, which is the first prime.  To get
the rest of the primes, we start by filtering the multiples of 2 from the rest
of the integers.  This leaves a stream beginning with 3, which is the next
prime.  Now we filter the multiples of 3 from the rest of this stream.  This
leaves a stream beginning with 5, which is the next prime, and so on.  In other
words, we construct the primes by a sieving process, described as follows: To
sieve a stream <code>S</code>, form a stream whose first element is the first element
of <code>S</code> and the rest of which is obtained by filtering all multiples of the
first element of <code>S</code> out of the rest of <code>S</code> and sieving the
result. This process is readily described in terms of stream operations:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (sieve stream)
  (cons-stream
   (stream-car stream)
   (sieve (stream-filter
           (lambda (x)
             (not (divisible? 
                   x (stream-car stream))))
           (stream-cdr stream)))))

(define primes 
  (sieve (integers-starting-from 2)))
</pre></div>

<p>Now to find a particular prime we need only ask for it:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(stream-ref primes 50)
<i>233</i>
</pre></div>

<p>It is interesting to contemplate the signal-processing system set up by
<code>sieve</code>, shown in the “Henderson diagram” in 
<a href="#Figure-3_002e31">Figure 3.31</a>.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF189" href="#FOOT189"><sup>189</sup></a>  The input stream
feeds into an “un<code>cons</code>er” that separates the first element of the
stream from the rest of the stream.  The first element is used to construct a
divisibility filter, through which the rest is passed, and the output of the
filter is fed to another sieve box.  Then the original first element is
<code>cons</code>ed onto the output of the internal sieve to form the output stream.
Thus, not only is the stream infinite, but the signal processor is also
infinite, because the sieve contains a sieve within it.

<a id="Defining-streams-implicitly"></a>
<h5 class="subsubheading">Defining streams implicitly</h5>

<p>The <code>integers</code> and <code>fibs</code> streams above were defined by specifying
“generating” procedures that explicitly compute the stream elements one by
one. An alternative way to specify streams is to take advantage of delayed
evaluation to define streams implicitly.  For example, the following expression
defines the stream <code>ones</code> to be an infinite stream of ones:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define ones (cons-stream 1 ones))
</pre></div>

<p>This works much like the definition of a recursive procedure: <code>ones</code> is a
pair whose <code>car</code> is 1 and whose <code>cdr</code> is a promise to evaluate
<code>ones</code>.  Evaluating the <code>cdr</code> gives us again a 1 and a promise to
evaluate <code>ones</code>, and so on.
</p>
<p>We can do more interesting things by manipulating streams with operations such
as <code>add-streams</code>, which produces the elementwise sum of two given
streams:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF190" href="#FOOT190"><sup>190</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (add-streams s1 s2) 
  (stream-map + s1 s2))
</pre></div>

<p>Now we can define the integers as follows:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define integers 
  (cons-stream 1 (add-streams ones integers)))
</pre></div>

<p>This defines <code>integers</code> to be a stream whose first element is 1 and the
rest of which is the sum of <code>ones</code> and <code>integers</code>.  Thus, the second
element of <code>integers</code> is 1 plus the first element of <code>integers</code>, or
2; the third element of <code>integers</code> is 1 plus the second element of
<code>integers</code>, or 3; and so on.  This definition works because, at any point,
enough of the <code>integers</code> stream has been generated so that we can feed it
back into the definition to produce the next integer.
</p>
<p>We can define the Fibonacci numbers in the same style:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define fibs 
  (cons-stream 
   0 (cons-stream 1 (add-streams 
                     (stream-cdr fibs) fibs))))
</pre></div>

<p>This definition says that <code>fibs</code> is a stream beginning with 0 and 1, such
that the rest of the stream can be generated by adding <code>fibs</code> to itself
shifted by one place:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">    1 1 2 3 5  8 13 21 <span class="roman">…</span> = <code>(stream-cdr fibs)</code>
    0 1 1 2 3  5  8 13 <span class="roman">…</span> = <code>fibs</code>
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 <span class="roman">…</span> = <code>fibs</code>
</pre></div>

<p><code>Scale-stream</code> is another useful procedure in formulating such stream
definitions.  This multiplies each item in a stream by a given constant:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (scale-stream stream factor)
  (stream-map
   (lambda (x) (* x factor)) stream))
</pre></div>

<p>For example,
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define double 
  (cons-stream 1 (scale-stream double 2)))
</pre></div>

<p>produces the stream of powers of 2: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ….
</p>
<p>An alternate definition of the stream of primes can be given by starting with
the integers and filtering them by testing for primality.  We will need the
first prime, 2, to get started:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define primes
  (cons-stream
   2 (stream-filter 
      prime? (integers-starting-from 3))))
</pre></div>

<p>This definition is not so straightforward as it appears, because we will test
whether a number \( n \) is prime by checking whether \( n \) is divisible by a
prime (not by just any integer) less than or equal to \( \sqrt{n} \):
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (prime? n)
  (define (iter ps)
    (cond ((&gt; (square (stream-car ps)) n) true)
          ((divisible? n (stream-car ps)) 
           false)
          (else (iter (stream-cdr ps)))))
  (iter primes))
</pre></div>

<p>This is a recursive definition, since <code>primes</code> is defined in terms of the
<code>prime?</code> predicate, which itself uses the <code>primes</code> stream.  The
reason this procedure works is that, at any point, enough of the <code>primes</code>
stream has been generated to test the primality of the numbers we need to check
next.  That is, for every \( n \) we test for primality, either \( n \) is not
prime (in which case there is a prime already generated that divides it) or
\( n \) is prime (in which case there is a prime already generated—i.e., a
prime less than \( n \)—that is greater than
\( \sqrt{n} \)).<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF191" href="#FOOT191"><sup>191</sup></a>

For example, <code>(partial-sums integers)</code> should be the
stream 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ….
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><a id="Exercise-3_002e56"></a>Exercise 3.56:</strong> A famous problem, first raised by
R. Hamming, is to enumerate, in ascending order with no repetitions, all
positive integers with no prime factors other than 2, 3, or 5.  One obvious way
to do this is to simply test each integer in turn to see whether it has any
factors other than 2, 3, and 5.  But this is very inefficient, since, as the
integers get larger, fewer and fewer of them fit the requirement.  As an
alternative, let us call the required stream of numbers <code>S</code> and notice the
following facts about it.
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>S</code> begins with 1.

</li><li> The elements of <code>(scale-stream S 2)</code> are also
elements of <code>S</code>.

</li><li> The same is true for <code>(scale-stream S 3)</code>
and <code>(scale-stream 5 S)</code>.

</li><li> These are all the elements of <code>S</code>.

</li></ul>

<p>Now all we have to do is combine elements from these sources.  For this we
define a procedure <code>merge</code> that combines two ordered streams into one
ordered result stream, eliminating repetitions:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (merge s1 s2)
  (cond ((stream-null? s1) s2)
        ((stream-null? s2) s1)
        (else
         (let ((s1car (stream-car s1))
               (s2car (stream-car s2)))
           (cond ((&lt; s1car s2car)
                  (cons-stream 
                   s1car 
                   (merge (stream-cdr s1) 
                          s2)))
                 ((&gt; s1car s2car)
                  (cons-stream 
                   s2car 
                   (merge s1 
                          (stream-cdr s2))))
                 (else
                  (cons-stream 
                   s1car
                   (merge 
                    (stream-cdr s1)
                    (stream-cdr s2)))))))))
</pre></div>

<p>Then the required stream may be constructed with <code>merge</code>, as follows:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define S (cons-stream 1 (merge ⟨??⟩ ⟨??⟩)))
</pre></div>

<p>Fill in the missing expressions in the places marked <code>⟨??⟩</code> above.

This last point is very subtle and relies on
the fact that \( {p_{n+1} \le p_n^2}. \)  (Here, \( p_k \) denotes the
\( k^{\text{th}} \) prime.)  Estimates such as these are very difficult to establish.  The
ancient proof by Euclid that there are an infinite number of primes shows that
\( p_{n+1} \le {p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n + 1} \), and no substantially
better result was proved until 1851, when the Russian mathematician
P. L. Chebyshev established that \( p_{n+1} \le 2p_n \) for all \( n \).
This result, originally conjectured in 1845, is known as <a id="index-Bertrand_0027s-hypothesis"></a>
<em>Bertrand’s hypothesis</em>.  
A proof can be found in section 22.3 of <a href="References.xhtml#Hardy-and-Wright-1960">Hardy and Wright 1960</a>.</p>

This exercise shows how call-by-need is closely related
to ordinary memoization as described in <a href="3_002e3_002e3.xhtml#Exercise-3_002e27">Exercise 3.27</a>.  In that exercise,
we used assignment to explicitly construct a local table.  Our call-by-need
stream optimization effectively constructs such a table automatically, storing
values in the previously forced parts of the stream.</p>
