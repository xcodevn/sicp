<a id="Streams-and-Delayed-Evaluation"></a>
<h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">3.5.4</span><span class="sectitle">Streams and Delayed Evaluation</span></h4>

<p>The <code>integral</code> procedure at the end of the preceding section shows how we
can use streams to model signal-processing systems that contain feedback loops.
The feedback loop for the adder shown in <a href="3_002e5_002e3.xhtml#Figure-3_002e32">Figure 3.32</a> is modeled by the
fact that <code>integral</code>’s internal stream <code>int</code> is defined in terms of
itself:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define int
  (cons-stream 
   initial-value
   (add-streams 
    (scale-stream integrand dt) int)))
</pre></div>

<p>The interpreter’s ability to deal with such an implicit definition depends on
the <code>delay</code> that is incorporated into <code>cons-stream</code>.  Without this
<code>delay</code>, the interpreter could not construct <code>int</code> before evaluating
both arguments to <code>cons-stream</code>, which would require that <code>int</code>
already be defined.  In general, <code>delay</code> is crucial for using streams to
model signal-processing systems that contain loops.  Without <code>delay</code>, our
models would have to be formulated so that the inputs to any signal-processing
component would be fully evaluated before the output could be produced.  This
would outlaw loops.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, stream models of systems with loops may require uses of
<code>delay</code> beyond the “hidden” <code>delay</code> supplied by <code>cons-stream</code>.
For instance, <a href="#Figure-3_002e34">Figure 3.34</a> shows a signal-processing system for solving
the differential equation \( {dy / dt = f(y)} \) where \( f \) is a given
function.  The figure shows a mapping component, which applies \( f \) to its
input signal, linked in a feedback loop to an integrator in a manner very
similar to that of the analog computer circuits that are actually used to solve
such equations.
</p>

<figcaption class="float-caption">
<p><strong>Figure 3.34:</strong> An “analog computer circuit” that solves the equation \( {dy / dt = f(y)} \).</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Assuming we are given an initial value \( y_0 \) for \( y \), we could try to model
this system using the procedure
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (solve f y0 dt)
  (define y (integral dy y0 dt))
  (define dy (stream-map f y))
  y)
</pre></div>

<p>This procedure does not work, because in the first line of <code>solve</code> the
call to <code>integral</code> requires that the input <code>dy</code> be defined, which
does not happen until the second line of <code>solve</code>.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the intent of our definition does make sense, because we
can, in principle, begin to generate the <code>y</code> stream without knowing
<code>dy</code>.  Indeed, <code>integral</code> and many other stream operations have
properties similar to those of <code>cons-stream</code>, in that we can generate part
of the answer given only partial information about the arguments.  For
<code>integral</code>, the first element of the output stream is the specified
<code>initial-value</code>.  Thus, we can generate the first element of the output
stream without evaluating the integrand <code>dy</code>.  Once we know the first
element of <code>y</code>, the <code>stream-map</code> in the second line of <code>solve</code>
can begin working to generate the first element of <code>dy</code>, which will
produce the next element of <code>y</code>, and so on.
</p>
<p>To take advantage of this idea, we will redefine <code>integral</code> to expect the
integrand stream to be a <a id="index-delayed-argument"></a>
<em>delayed argument</em>.  <code>Integral</code> will
<code>force</code> the integrand to be evaluated only when it is required to generate
more than the first element of the output stream:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (integral
         delayed-integrand initial-value dt)
  (define int
    (cons-stream 
     initial-value
     (let ((integrand 
            (force delayed-integrand)))
       (add-streams 
        (scale-stream integrand dt)
        int))))
  int)
</pre></div>

<p>Now we can implement our <code>solve</code> procedure by delaying the evaluation of
<code>dy</code> in the definition of <code>y</code>:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF199" href="#FOOT199"><sup>199</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (solve f y0 dt)
  (define y (integral (delay dy) y0 dt))
  (define dy (stream-map f y))
  y)
</pre></div>

<p>In general, every caller of <code>integral</code> must now <code>delay</code> the integrand
argument.  We can demonstrate that the <code>solve</code> procedure works by
approximating \( {e \approx 2.718} \) by computing the value at \( {y = 1} \) of the
solution to the differential equation \( {dy / dt = y} \) with initial
condition \( {y(0) = 1} \):
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(stream-ref 
 (solve (lambda (y) y) 1 0.001) 1000)
<i>2.716924</i>
</pre></div>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><a id="Exercise-3_002e77"></a>Exercise 3.77:</strong> The <code>integral</code> procedure
used above was analogous to the “implicit” definition of the infinite stream
of integers in <a href="3_002e5_002e2.xhtml#g_t3_002e5_002e2">3.5.2</a>.  Alternatively, we can give a definition of
<code>integral</code> that is more like <code>integers-starting-from</code> (also in
<a href="3_002e5_002e2.xhtml#g_t3_002e5_002e2">3.5.2</a>):
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (integral
         integrand initial-value dt)
  (cons-stream 
   initial-value
   (if (stream-null? integrand)
       the-empty-stream
       (integral 
        (stream-cdr integrand)
        (+ (* dt (stream-car integrand))
           initial-value)
        dt))))
</pre></div>

<p>When used in systems with loops, this procedure has the same problem as does
our original version of <code>integral</code>.  Modify the procedure so that it
expects the <code>integrand</code> as a delayed argument and hence can be used in the
<code>solve</code> procedure shown above.

differential equation
\[ % :74:
  {d^2 \kern-0.07em y \over dt^2} - {a {dy \over dt}} - {by} \,=\, {0.}  \]
The output stream, modeling \( y \), is generated by a network that contains a
loop. This is because the value of \( {d^2 \kern-0.1em y / dt^2} \) depends upon the
values of \( y \) and \( {dy / dt} \) and both of these are determined by
integrating \( {d^2 \kern-0.1em y / dt^2} \).  The diagram we would like to encode is

consists of a resistor, a capacitor, and an inductor connected in series, as
shown in <a href="#Figure-3_002e36">Figure 3.36</a>.  If \( R \), \( L \), and \( C \) are the resistance,
inductance, and capacitance, then the relations between voltage \( {(v)} \) and

<h5 class="subsubheading">Normal-order evaluation</h5>

<p>The examples in this section illustrate how the explicit use of <code>delay</code>
and <code>force</code> provides great programming flexibility, but the same examples
also show how this can make our programs more complex.  Our new <code>integral</code>
procedure, for instance, gives us the power to model systems with loops, but we
must now remember that <code>integral</code> should be called with a delayed
integrand, and every procedure that uses <code>integral</code> must be aware of this.
In effect, we have created two classes of procedures: ordinary procedures and
procedures that take delayed arguments.  In general, creating separate classes
of procedures forces us to create separate classes of higher-order procedures
as well.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF200" href="#FOOT200"><sup>200</sup></a>
</p>
<p>One way to avoid the need for two different classes of procedures is to make
all procedures take delayed arguments.  We could adopt a model of evaluation in
which all arguments to procedures are automatically delayed and arguments are
forced only when they are actually needed (for example, when they are required
by a primitive operation).  This would transform our language to use
normal-order evaluation, which we first described when we introduced the
substitution model for evaluation in <a href="1_002e1_002e5.xhtml#g_t1_002e1_002e5">1.1.5</a>.  Converting to
normal-order evaluation provides a uniform and elegant way to simplify the use
of delayed evaluation, and this would be a natural strategy to adopt if we were
concerned only with stream processing.  In <a href="4_002e2.xhtml#g_t4_002e2">4.2</a>, after we have
studied the evaluator, we will see how to transform our language in just this
way.  Unfortunately, including delays in procedure calls wreaks havoc with our
ability to design programs that depend on the order of events, such as programs
that use assignment, mutate data, or perform input or output.  Even the single
<code>delay</code> in <code>cons-stream</code> can cause great confusion, as illustrated by
<a href="3_002e5_002e1.xhtml#Exercise-3_002e51">Exercise 3.51</a> and <a href="3_002e5_002e1.xhtml#Exercise-3_002e52">Exercise 3.52</a>.  As far as anyone knows,
mutability and delayed evaluation do not mix well in programming languages, and
devising ways to deal with both of these at once is an active area of research.

This procedure is not
guaranteed to work in all Scheme implementations, although for any
implementation there is a simple variation that will work.  The problem has to
do with subtle differences in the ways that Scheme implementations handle
internal definitions.  (See <a href="4_002e1_002e6.xhtml#g_t4_002e1_002e6">4.1.6</a>.)</p>

This is a small reflection, in Lisp, of the difficulties that
conventional strongly typed languages such as Pascal have in coping with
higher-order procedures.  In such languages, the programmer must specify the
data types of the arguments and the result of each procedure: number, logical
value, sequence, and so on.  Consequently, we could not express an abstraction
such as “map a given procedure <code>proc</code> over all the elements in a
sequence” by a single higher-order procedure such as <code>stream-map</code>.
Rather, we would need a different mapping procedure for each different
combination of argument and result data types that might be specified for a
<code>proc</code>.  Maintaining a practical notion of “data type” in the presence
of higher-order procedures raises many difficult issues.  One way of dealing
with this problem is illustrated by the language ML (<a href="References.xhtml#Gordon-et-al_002e-1979">Gordon et al. 1979</a>), 
whose “polymorphic data types” include templates for
higher-order transformations between data types.  Moreover, data types for most
procedures in ML are never explicitly declared by the programmer.  Instead, ML
includes a <a id="index-type_002dinferencing"></a>
<em>type-inferencing</em> mechanism that uses information in the
environment to deduce the data types for newly defined procedures.</p>
