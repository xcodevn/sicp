<a id="Tree-Recursion"></a>
<h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">1.2.2</span><span class="sectitle">Tree Recursion</span></h4>

<p>Another common pattern of computation is called <a id="index-tree-recursion"></a>
<em>tree recursion</em>.  As
an example, consider computing the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, in which each
number is the sum of the preceding two:
</p>
<div style="text-align: center">0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ….
</div>
<p>In general, the Fibonacci numbers can be defined by the rule

\[ % :7:
  
\text{Fib}(n) \; = \;
  \left\{ 
    \begin{array}{ll}	 	 
      0 &amp; \;\text{if} \;\; n = 0, \\
      1 &amp; \;\text{if} \;\; n = 1, \\
      \text{Fib}(n-1) + \text{Fib}(n-2) &amp; \;\text{otherwise}. 
    \end{array} 
  \right. 
\]

We can immediately translate this definition into a recursive procedure for
computing Fibonacci numbers:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (fib n)
  (cond ((= n 0) 0)
        ((= n 1) 1)
        (else (+ (fib (- n 1))
                 (fib (- n 2))))))
</pre></div>

<p>Consider the pattern of this computation.  To compute <code>(fib 5)</code>, we
compute <code>(fib 4)</code> and <code>(fib 3)</code>.  To compute <code>(fib 4)</code>, we
compute <code>(fib 3)</code> and <code>(fib 2)</code>.  In general, the evolved process
looks like a tree, as shown in <a href="#Figure-1_002e5">Figure 1.5</a>.  Notice that the branches
split into two at each level (except at the bottom); this reflects the fact
that the <code>fib</code> procedure calls itself twice each time it is invoked.
</p>
<figure class="float">
<a id="Figure-1_002e5"></a>
<object style="width: 58.07ex; height: 36.18ex;" data="fig/chap1/Fig1.5d.std.svg" type="image/svg+xml">SVG</object>

<figcaption class="float-caption">
<p><strong>Figure 1.5:</strong> The tree-recursive process generated in computing <code>(fib 5)</code>.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This procedure is instructive as a prototypical tree recursion, but it is a
terrible way to compute Fibonacci numbers because it does so much redundant
computation.  Notice in <a href="#Figure-1_002e5">Figure 1.5</a> that the entire computation of
<code>(fib 3)</code>—almost half the work—is duplicated.  In fact, it is not hard
to show that the number of times the procedure will compute <code>(fib 1)</code> or
<code>(fib 0)</code> (the number of leaves in the above tree, in general) is
precisely \( {\text{Fib}(n+1)} \).  To get an idea of how bad this is, one can
show that the value of \( {\text{Fib}(n)} \) grows exponentially with \( n \).  More
precisely (see <a href="#Exercise-1_002e13">Exercise 1.13</a>), \( {\text{Fib}(n)} \) is the closest integer
to \( {\varphi^n / \sqrt{5}} \), where

\[ % :8:

\varphi \,=\, \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \,\approx\, 1.6180
\]

is the <a id="index-golden-ratio"></a>
<em>golden ratio</em>, which satisfies the equation

\[ % :9:
 
\varphi^2 \,=\, {\varphi + 1.}
\]

Thus, the process uses a number of steps that grows exponentially with the
input.  On the other hand, the space required grows only linearly with the
input, because we need keep track only of which nodes are above us in the tree
at any point in the computation.  In general, the number of steps required by a
tree-recursive process will be proportional to the number of nodes in the tree,
while the space required will be proportional to the maximum depth of the tree.
</p>
<p>We can also formulate an iterative process for computing the Fibonacci numbers.
The idea is to use a pair of integers \( a \) and \( b \), initialized to
\( {\text{Fib(1) = 1}} \) and \( {\text{Fib(0) = 0}} \), and to repeatedly apply the
simultaneous transformations
</p>

\[ % :10:
 
\begin{array}{l}
  a \;\leftarrow\; a + b, \\ 
  b \;\leftarrow\; a. 
\end{array}
\]

<p>It is not hard to show that, after applying this transformation \( n \) times,
\( a \) and \( b \) will be equal, respectively, to \( {\text{Fib}(n+1)} \) and
\( {\text{Fib}(n)} \).  Thus, we can compute Fibonacci numbers iteratively using
the procedure
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (fib n) 
  (fib-iter 1 0 n))

(define (fib-iter a b count)
  (if (= count 0)
      b
      (fib-iter (+ a b) a (- count 1))))
</pre></div>

<p>This second method for computing \( {\text{Fib}(n)} \) is a linear iteration.  The
difference in number of steps required by the two methods—one linear in
\( n \), one growing as fast as \( {\text{Fib}(n)} \) itself—is enormous, even for
small inputs.
</p>
<p>One should not conclude from this that tree-recursive processes are useless.
When we consider processes that operate on hierarchically structured data
rather than numbers, we will find that tree recursion is a natural and powerful
tool.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF32" href="#FOOT32"><sup>32</sup></a> But
even in numerical operations, tree-recursive processes can be useful in helping
us to understand and design programs.  For instance, although the first
<code>fib</code> procedure is much less efficient than the second one, it is more
straightforward, being little more than a translation into Lisp of the
definition of the Fibonacci sequence.  To formulate the iterative algorithm
required noticing that the computation could be recast as an iteration with
three state variables.
</p>
<a id="Example_003a-Counting-change"></a>
<h5 class="subsubheading">Example: Counting change</h5>

<p>It takes only a bit of cleverness to come up with the iterative Fibonacci
algorithm.  In contrast, consider the following problem: How many different
ways can we make change of $1.00, given half-dollars, quarters, dimes,
nickels, and pennies?  More generally, can we write a procedure to compute the
number of ways to change any given amount of money?
</p>
<p>This problem has a simple solution as a recursive procedure.  Suppose we think
of the types of coins available as arranged in some order.  Then the following
relation holds:
</p>
<p>The number of ways to change amount \( a \) using \( n \) kinds of coins equals
</p>
<ul>
<li> the number of ways to change amount \( a \) using all but the first kind of coin,
plus

</li><li> the number of ways to change amount \( {a - d} \) using all \( n \) kinds of
coins, where \( d \) is the denomination of the first kind of coin.

</li></ul>

<p>To see why this is true, observe that the ways to make change can be divided
into two groups: those that do not use any of the first kind of coin, and those
that do.  Therefore, the total number of ways to make change for some amount is
equal to the number of ways to make change for the amount without using any of
the first kind of coin, plus the number of ways to make change assuming that we
do use the first kind of coin.  But the latter number is equal to the number of
ways to make change for the amount that remains after using a coin of the first
kind.
</p>
<p>Thus, we can recursively reduce the problem of changing a given amount to the
problem of changing smaller amounts using fewer kinds of coins.  Consider this
reduction rule carefully, and convince yourself that we can use it to describe
an algorithm if we specify the following degenerate cases:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF33" href="#FOOT33"><sup>33</sup></a>
</p>
<ul>
<li> If \( a \) is exactly 0, we should count that as 1 way to make change.

</li><li> If \( a \) is less than 0, we should count that as 0 ways to make change.

</li><li> If \( n \) is 0, we should count that as 0 ways to make change.

</li></ul>

<p>We can easily translate this description into a recursive procedure:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (count-change amount)
  (cc amount 5))

(define (cc amount kinds-of-coins)
  (cond ((= amount 0) 1)
        ((or (&lt; amount 0) 
             (= kinds-of-coins 0)) 
         0)
        (else 
         (+ (cc amount (- kinds-of-coins 1))
            (cc (- amount (first-denomination 
                           kinds-of-coins))
                kinds-of-coins)))))

(define (first-denomination kinds-of-coins)
  (cond ((= kinds-of-coins 1) 1)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 2) 5)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 3) 10)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 4) 25)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 5) 50)))
</pre></div>

<p>(The <code>first-denomination</code> procedure takes as input the number of kinds of
coins available and returns the denomination of the first kind.  Here we are
thinking of the coins as arranged in order from largest to smallest, but any
order would do as well.)  We can now answer our original question about
changing a dollar:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(count-change 100)
<i>292</i>
</pre></div>

<p><code>Count-change</code> generates a tree-recursive process with redundancies
similar to those in our first implementation of <code>fib</code>.  (It will take
quite a while for that 292 to be computed.)  On the other hand, it is not
obvious how to design a better algorithm for computing the result, and we leave
this problem as a challenge.  The observation that a tree-recursive process may
be highly inefficient but often easy to specify and understand has led people
to propose that one could get the best of both worlds by designing a “smart
compiler” that could transform tree-recursive procedures into more efficient
procedures that compute the same result.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF34" href="#FOOT34"><sup>34</sup></a>

One approach to coping with
redundant computations is to arrange matters so that we automatically construct
a table of values as they are computed.  Each time we are asked to apply the
procedure to some argument, we first look to see if the value is already stored
in the table, in which case we avoid performing the redundant computation.
This strategy, known as <a id="index-tabulation"></a>
<em>tabulation</em> or <a id="index-memoization"></a>
<em>memoization</em>, can be
implemented in a straightforward way.  Tabulation can sometimes be used to
transform processes that require an exponential number of steps (such as
<code>count-change</code>) into processes whose space and time requirements grow
linearly with the input.  See <a href="3_002e3_002e3.xhtml#Exercise-3_002e27">Exercise 3.27</a>.</p>

<em>binomial coefficients</em>, because the
\( {n^{\text{th}}} \) row consists of the coefficients of the terms in the expansion of
\( {(x + y)^n} \).  This pattern for computing the coefficients appeared in
